      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        Julian Fernando Casablancas (born August 23, 1978) is an American
        singer, musician, and songwriter, best known as the lead vocalist and
        primary songwriter of rock band The Strokes, with whom he has released
        six studio albums since their founding in 1998. Casablancas released a
        solo album, Phrazes for the Young, in 2009. That same year, he founded
        the independent record label Cult Records, which has represented artists
        such as The Growlers, Rey Pila, and Karen O. Since 2013, he has been the
        frontman of experimental rock band The Voidz. The band has released two
        albums, Tyranny (2014) and Virtue (2018).

      <h2>Early life</h2>
      <p>
        Julian Fernando Casablancas was born in New York City on August 23,
        1978, the son of American-Spanish businessman John Casablancas, the
        founder of Elite Model Management, and Jeanette Christiansen (née
        Christjansen), a Danish model and the 1965 Miss Denmark who later became
        an artist. When Casablancas was eight, his parents divorced. He
        once stated that he wanted to be closer to his father, which "translated
        into teenage rebelliousness". His mother later married Ghanaian
        painter Sam Adoquei, who helped shape Casablancas' early musical
        taste by exposing him to music such as The Doors, which was markedly
        different from the mostly Phil Collins-influenced music he listened to
        as a child. He has several half-siblings, including an elder sister
        from his father's first marriage, and three other siblings from his
        father's third marriage.

        Casablancas met future Strokes bassist Nikolai Fraiture when they were
        six years old, while both were attending the bilingual French school
        Lycée Français de New York. When he was 13, his father sent him
        to the Institut Le Rosey boarding school in Switzerland, to improve his
        grades, where he met future Strokes guitarist Albert Hammond, Jr. He
        later returned to New York and attended Dwight School with two other
        future Strokes bandmates: guitarist Nick Valensi and drummer Fabrizio
        Moretti. He never finished high school, but took a GED and
        continued to take music classes at Five Towns College, which he later
        said was the first time he enjoyed himself in class.
